12/10/23
v.1.0.2
- added 'cycleReset' variable to be able to stop vacuum cycling in console. Type 'cycleReset = 1' in console,
it's value will automatically return to 0 after stopping cycle.
- cycling now stops switching when you turn it off instead of finishing cycle.
But continues at next tabs if you turn it back before end of current cycle.
- script auto building now uses in-game inputted delay when you have at least 1 lvl in Strangeness 'More toggles',
otherwise it is usual double-price.
- "Advanced" tab - now also takes active Void into account, if you are not in Void - exit Advanced tab only after
moving mouse over Vacuum image or script might work incorrectly.
- added 'stageResetEnable' variable to enable\disable (1\0) auto-stage resets. Only console manageable.
And a check if you have Strangeness auto-stage upgrade so you don't have to worry disabling this.
- changed Cloud reset logic a bit and added additional checks. Commented out 'vacuumCloudMulti' from Submerged Cloud
accumulation condition and from auto-Stage reset for now. Added turning off auto-Enchancements when accumulating Clouds.
